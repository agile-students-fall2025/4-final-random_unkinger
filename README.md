# NutriLens


## Project Vision Statement
To create an engaging, accessible, and intelligent healthy-eating app that helps users understand what they eat, build better habits, and track their food and activity in one place.
Through a balance of education, visual design, and simple tracking tools, the app empowers users to make mindful choices and sustain healthier lifestyles.

## Project Description
Between packed schedules and endless food choices, staying healthy often falls to the bottom of our list. *Nutrilens* helps users build better habits by tracking meals and activities, scanning foods for quick insights, and offering simple nutrition tips that make healthy living approachable.

## Project History
NutriLens came to be through the Agile Software Development & DevOps class for Fall 2025. Our team completed a project proposal to work on for the entire semester, the outcome of that being NutriLens. We were inspired by how complicated nutrition apps can be â€” endless numbers, confusing data, and cluttered interfaces that make eating healthy feel like work. We wanted to design something that felt different: a playful, intelligent companion that makes food tracking simple, educational, and even fun.
